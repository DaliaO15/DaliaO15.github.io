I am a mathematician, who went into data science, with over three years of experience using machine learning and advanced data science techniques to drive decision-making and uncover actionable insights in the science and technology space. I collaborate with stakeholders to test and implement innovative ideas, developing impactful solutions using a diverse range of tools and technologies.

My work and interests span multiple fields—including biology, chemistry, digital humanities, and social sciences—where I have applied both machine learning and applied mathematics to solve complex problems. What drives me is working on projects that create real impact, whether on a small or large scale. I enjoy tackling challenges and solving problems, as I believe this is the best way to stay sharp and continuously learn.

Beyond my professional work, I am deeply passionate about making education accessible to all. For over six years, I volunteered as an area coordinator and teacher in a non-profit initiative, helping teenagers from marginalized communities in my hometown build strong mathematical foundations. This not only contributed to their basic education but also prepared them for the national exam required to enter high school—a particularly challenging hurdle for students with limited resources.

Outside of work, I’m a book and cat enthusiast. I love reading both fiction and nonfiction. Some books that have stuck with me include _The Millionaire Next Door_ by Thomas J. Stanley, which explores how millionaires manage their money, and _The Last Girl_ by Nadia Murad, a powerful account of the Yazidi genocide of 2014. I also enjoy dancing, sewing, DIY projects, cooking, and exploring new interests—lately, I’ve been getting into botany.
