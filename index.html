title: "About me"
---
I am a data scientist with 3+ years of experience leveraging machine learning models and advanced data science techniques to drive decision-making and generate actionable insights in the science and technology space. I help companies test and implement cutting-edge ideas, working with stakeholders to develop impactful solutions using diverse tools and technologies.<br />

Beyond my professional work, I am passionate about making education accessible for everyone. For over 6+ years, I volunteered as an area coordinator and teacher in a non-profit initiative, helping teenagers from marginalised communities develop strong mathematical foundations.<br />

Appart from the avobe, I am a cat and book lover, I enjoy dancing and sewing, DIY, cooking and learning new cool stuff.
