I am Dalia - a Research Engineer (Data Scientist) at the CDHU, Uppsala University, where I work primarily on computer vision applications. I also work a bit with web scraping 
because I think is fun and actively contribute to education initiatives, including lifelong learning courses and technical workshops.
